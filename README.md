## Features

- **Hourly time-blocks:** The scheduler accommodates a wide range of hours, starting from 5 AM and ending at 10 PM, offering scheduling opportunities for both early birds and night owls.
- **Color-coded blocks:** The scheduler offers color-coded blocks that visually indicate whether a block of time has passed (gray), is currently active (red), or is yet to come (green).
- **Task persistence:** The tasks you enter will be stored in your browser's local storage. This means that your tasks will remain available even after you close the browser.
- **Clear schedule:** A "Clear My Schedule" button is available to clear all your tasks at once, offering a clean slate whenever needed.

## Usage

To use the Work Day Scheduler, simply load the webpage and click on the text area within the hourly blocks to input your tasks. When you've finished entering a task, click the save button to store the task in your local storage.

You can also use the "Clear My Schedule" button located in the footer to clear all your tasks.
